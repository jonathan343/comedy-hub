# ComedyHub Project Context

## Project Overview
ComedyHub is a platform that helps fans discover live stand-up comedy shows, track their favorite comedians, and receive alerts when new performances are announced. Built with both casual fans and die-hard comedy lovers in mind, ComedyHub makes it effortless to stay in the loop—whether you're looking for something fun to do tonight or trying to catch your favorite comic on their next set.

## Problem Statement
Comedy enthusiasts currently face significant friction in discovering shows - they must manually check multiple venue websites, follow dozens of social media accounts, and rely on word-of-mouth to stay informed about performances. This fragmented approach leads to missed shows and poor discovery of new comedians.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with Row Level Security)
- **ORM**: Supabase JavaScript client
- **Deployment**: Ready for Vercel
- **Package Manager**: npm

## Project Status: Backend Complete ✅ | Frontend In Progress 🚧

     - Search by comedian name
     - Filter by city and date
     - Responsive card-based layout
     - Pagination support
     - Real-time API integration
     - Loading and error states
     - Dark mode support

5. **Type Safety**
   - Complete TypeScript interfaces for all entities
   - Proper path aliases configured (@/* -> src/*)

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **comedians** - Comedian profiles, bios, social links
- **venues** - Comedy clubs/venues with location data
- **shows** - Individual comedy performances/events
- **show_performers** - Many-to-many: shows ↔ comedians

### User Tables  
- **profiles** - User accounts (extends Supabase auth)
- **user_follows** - Users following comedians
- **user_favorites** - Users favoriting shows

### Key Relationships
```
shows → venues (many-to-one)
shows ← show_performers → comedians (many-to-many)
users ← user_follows → comedians (many-to-many)
users ← user_favorites → shows (many-to-many)
```

## API Examples

### Get Comedians
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/comedians?limit=5&search=jerry"
```

### Get Shows with Filters
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/shows?city=Los Angeles&limit=3"
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/shows?comedian=dave"
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/shows?date=2025-07-29"
```

### Response Structure
Shows include full venue details and performer lineup:
```json
{
  "data": [{
    "id": "...",
    "title": "Comedy Night with Jerry Seinfeld", 
    "venue": {
      "name": "Comedy Cellar",

    }]
  }]
}
```
